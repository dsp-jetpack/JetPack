### This script is responsible for applying patches to the OSP Director. The
### patches provide an interim workaround until bug(s) are resolved upstream.
###
### It's possible that updating the Director (via yum) will affect files in
### a way that a patch is no longer relevant, or no longer cleanly applies.
### If this situation arises, the patch data in this file will need to be
### updated to work with the new Director code.
