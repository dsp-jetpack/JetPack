## Introduction 

### About this Document

Dell EMC Ready Architecture for Redhat OpenStack Platform Version 13. Provides the an automation for the deployment of the redhat openstack platform. In addition, a validation of the deployment on specific hardware, that garentees the success of the deployment and the effeciency of the configuration for the required workloads. 

Dell EMC Ready Architecture for Redhat OpenStack has validated the deployment of Redhat OpenStack using JetPack automation scripts on Dell EMC Rack Mount servers including R640, R740, R740XD. However, the same automation can be used to deploy the platform on other hardware options. 

Dell EMC professional services team has validated the deployment on other platforms including DSS9000. This document will show the verification procedure to make sure that the deployment will run smoothly as expected. you may use the same process to validate other Dell hardware options and combinations.

For a full documentation of JetPack deployment, please refere to the deployment guide, [https://github.com/dsp-jetpack/JetPack/tree/JS-13.0/doc/deployment_guide.md](https://github.com/dsp-jetpack/JetPack/tree/JS-13.0/doc/deployment_guide.md)


### About Dell DSS 9000

The DSS 9000 comes pre-integrated and designed to customer requirements. Simply roll DSS 9000 racks into the datacenter, plug them into a power supply and manage at the rack-level as well as across the entire infrastructure to accelerate time to value and deliver a better TCO.

## Hardware & Network Architecture 

### Network Architecture 

Dell EMC JetPack Automation includes many configuration options. The purpose of the exercise documented in this document is to validate the automation process for the DSS9k servers with sample configurations and networking using 4 network ports. The diagram below shows the network architecture that was validated in this document.

> **Note:** The last 2 versions of JetPack (version 10.2, and version 13) where validated as part of this document. the following diagram should apply for both versions of the automation.

## Jetpack 10.2 Deployment on DSS9000

### Changes to JetPack 10.2 Python Automation Files

When deploying Redhat OpenStack using JetPack 10.2 the DSS Hardware details are not included in configuration files. So once the SAH node is deployed; few modifications need to be done in the JetPack Python automation file.

1.	Modify /root/JetPack/src/pilot/dell_systems.json to add the DSS 9000 model type. At the end of this file add following entries.

	``` yaml
	“DSS 9600”: {
	“pxe_nic”: “NIC.Mezzanine.3-1-1”
	```

This Will identify the system to ironic and lets it know that the pxe nics for the systems will be on the Mezzanine nic in slot 3, port1. 


2.	Since all the nodes have HBA controllers and no BOSS or H730P controllers, a modification to assign_roles.py had to be done:

	``` python
	def generate_osd_config(ip_mac_service_tag, drac_client):
	    controllers = drac_client.list_raid_controllers()
	
	    found_hba = False
	    
	    for controller in controllers:
	        if "hba330" in controller.model.lower():
	            found_hba = True
	            break
	            
	    found_boss = False
	    for controller in controllers:
	        if controller.model.startswith("BOSS"):
	            found_boss = True
	            break

		if not found_hba and found_boss:
			LOG.info("Not generating OSD config for {ip} because no HBA330 or BOSS "
	                 "present.".format(ip=ip_mac_service_tag))
	        return
			
	    if not found_hba:
	        LOG.info("Not generating OSD config for {ip} because no HBA330 is "
	                 "present.".format(ip=ip_mac_service_tag))
	        return
	
	    ....
	
	```
	 

3.	Running config_idrac.py through the automated scripts would timeout so a modification was needed to extend the time given.

	* Change directory on the SAH node to /root/JetPack/src/pilot/discover_nodes/discover_nodes/dracclient

	* Edit the client.py file. Do a search for the word “super”. It will return following:

		``` python
		Super(DRACClient, Self)._init_(host,
						   Username,
						   Password,
						   Port,
						   Path,
						   Protocol)
		```

	* Add ready_retries= to the end so it looks like:
	
		``` python
		Super(DRACClient, Self)._init_(host,
						   Username,
						   Password,
						   Port,
						   Path,
						   Protocol,
						   Ready_retries=96)
		```

## Jetpack 13 Deployment on DSS9000

### Changes and Validation of JetPack 13 Python Automation Files

In JetPack 13; the modifications required for deployment on DSS9000 are already included the automation scripts. So before starting the deployment ensure below entries are updated the scripts.

1. Check following entries are updated in /root/JetPack/src/pilot/ dell_systems.json for DSS entries. This file contains the model and PXE NIC details. Usually this file contain PowerEdge server details, just make sure DSS hardware details also updated here.

	``` json 
	{
	  ....
	  ....
	  ....
	  ,
	  "PowerEdge R740": {
	    "pxe_nic": "NIC.Integrated.1-3-1"
	  },
	  "PowerEdge R740xd": {
	    "pxe_nic": "NIC.Integrated.1-3-1"
	  },
	  "PowerEdge R640": {
	    "pxe_nic": "NIC.Integrated.1-3-1"
	  },
	  "DSS 9600": {
	    "pxe_nic": "NIC.Mezzanine.3-1-1"
	  },
	  "DSS 9620": {
	    "pxe_nic": "NIC.Mezzanine.3-1-1"
	  }
	}
	
	```
 
	when the automation script communicate with IDRAC, it will retrive the model of the system and it will match for example with DSS 9600 or DSS 9620, it will then assign the pxe_nic mentioned in the JSON file as a the pxe boot interface. the function that does that is in config_idrac.py
	
	``` python
	def get_pxe_nic_fqdd_from_model_properties(model_properties, drac_client):
	    if model_properties is None:
	        return None
		
	    model_name = drac_client.get_system().model
		
	    # If the model does not have an entry in the model properties JSON file,
	    # return None, instead of raising a KeyError exception.
	    if model_name in model_properties:
	        return model_properties[model_name]['pxe_nic']
	    else:
	        return None
		
	```
	
	> Note: In case want to include a different server, and you need to change the PXE boot interface you can use the same file to do the changes.
	


2.	Since all the nodes have HBA controller ensure /root/JetPack/src/pilot/assign_roles.py are updated with below entries

	``` python
	def generate_osd_config(ip_mac_service_tag, drac_client):
	    controllers = drac_client.list_raid_controllers()
	
	    found_hba = False
	    for controller in controllers:
	        if "hba330" in controller.model.lower():
	            found_hba = True
	            break
	
	    if not found_hba:
	        LOG.info("Not generating OSD config for {ip} because no HBA330 is "
	                 "present.".format(ip=ip_mac_service_tag))
	        return
	
	    LOG.info("Generating OSD config for {ip}".format(ip=ip_mac_service_tag))
	    system_id = drac_client.get_system().uuid
	```

### known Issues


1. Before starting the deployment, make sure to clone the lastest version of JetPack; to avoid iDRAC patch issue. the latest version can be found on [https://github.com/dsp-jetpack/JetPack.git](https://github.com/dsp-jetpack/JetPack.git)

2. During director deployment in case you had the below error, that could be due to multiple deployment trials with different configuration of version locking; Add 'yum versionlock clear' to /root/JetPack/src/pilot/install-director.sh; that should clear any version locking configurations and the following error should be cleared after applying the change. 

	![](media/versionlockerror.png)



### Sample Configuration Files

the following configuration files where used to deploy jetpack 13 on DSS9000 stamp

#### dss9k_v13_acme.ini

you will notice in the configuration file acme.ini that we are using 4 ports configuration as per the hardware avaiable for that you need to set the correct nic_env_file parameter as below

``` yaml 
nic_env_file=4_port/nic_environment.yaml

``` 
**Other valid options are: **

1. To enable standard XSP profile or standard CSP profile (NUMA and HugePages):
   For 5 ports, choose 5_port/nic_environment.yaml. 
   For 4 ports, choose 4_port/nic_environment.yaml.
2. To enable OVS-DPDK with 7 nic ports, choose ovs-dpdk_7_port/nic_environment.yaml.
   For 9 ports, choose ovs-dpdk_9_port/nic_enviornment.yaml.
3. To enable SR-IOV with 7 nic ports, choose sriov_7_port/nic_environment.yaml.
   For 9 ports, choose sriov_9_port/nic_enviornment.yaml.
4. To enable OVS-DPDK (2-ports) and SR-IOV (2-ports), choose ovs-dpdk_sriov_9_port/nic_environment.yaml.
5. To enable DVR, for Storage and Floating networks that share a single bond, choose 5_port/nic_environment.yaml.
   If a separate bond is required for Floating network on compute nodes, choose dvr_7_port/nic_environment.yaml.
