# Hyper Converged Infrastructure Ready Architecture on Red Hat Openstack


## Description

Hyper-convergence is a type of infrastructure system that is largely software-defined with tightly-integrated compute, storage, networking and
virtualization resources. With hyper-convergence in place, customers just do not eliminate traditional storage infrastructure but they do gain
far more efficient management constructs, configurations, monitoring, and troubleshooting. The result is that hyper-convergence is easier and
less time-consuming to manage than traditional infrastructure.
Dell EMC Hyper Converged Infrastructure for Red Hat OpenStack Platform is designed in such way that by integrating compute and storage together
on a single aggregated cluster, making it a well suited solution for low-footprint remote or central office installation and edge computing.
Hyper-Converged Infrastructures (HCI) uses Red Hat Ceph Storage as a storage provider. This infrastructure features hyper-converged nodes,
where Compute and Ceph Storage services are collocated and configured for optimized resource usage. With this repository, user should be able
to access kick-start files, templates, validation scripts and documentation which are needed to perform deployment.
